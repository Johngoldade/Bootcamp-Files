        <h2>The Beginning of My Journey</h2>
        <p>We all have that moment in life where we decide we aren't happy with where we are, and a defining moment happens when we face these woes. For me, I was unsatisfied with my current career trajectory. A skillset that was taught to me by my father had made me very successful but I kept wanting more. To apply myself to learning another skill and "level up" my career was a motivating factor. My goal: software engineering and the hope of one day getting into Data Science and Machine learning. Signing up for bootcamp was step one.

        <h2>KU Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>Signing up for a bootcamp with the University of Kansas was actually very easy. Following this <a href="https://bootcamp.ku.edu/coding/">link</a>, it was very easy to sign up for the 24 week program. As I have only currently just started class, the experience is incomplete, but I can say that after a few classes, I already love doing this. I pray I will never regret this decision.</p>
